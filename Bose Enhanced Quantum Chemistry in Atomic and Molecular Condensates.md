Ultimate goal: quantum degeneracy (condensates): fully governed by quantum mechanics for all atoms occupy a quantum state
	towards colder and denser
Molecular BEC <---> Cooper pair BCS superfluid
(weak<--->strong coupling)

Atom molecule transition
$$ \hat{V}_\text{int} = \hat{\epsilon} \hat{\psi}_m^\dagger\hat{\psi}_m + g\hat{\psi}^\dagger_a\hat{\psi}^\dagger_a\hat{\psi}_a + \mathrm{H.C.}$$
Chemical reaction: driven by thermal energy (High Temp)
(Low temp) reaction as quantum effects (condensates)

Reversible processes: degenerate states (few permutations)
